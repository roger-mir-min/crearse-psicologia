# Crearse - Psicolog√≠a y Arte

## Background

Web created for a client, following her instructions. She can modify almost all the information contained in it. There is information about her and the services she offers, as well as a blog. This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 16.1.1.

## Stack

-Frontend: Angular 16.1.1, Service Workers, Kolkov Angular Editor, Tailwind, AOS. I had to come up with some workarounds to include to the editor functionalities that aren't built-in, such as resizing images.
-Backend: Firebase (Firestore, Storage). 

## Installing
1. Clone this repository https://github.com/roger-mir-min/crearse-psicologia.git
2. Install node_modules with "npm i" command

## Usage
Regular (unregistered) users can just navigate around the different pages of the website. When clicking on "Pide cita" ("make an appointment") button, they will be redirected to Whatsapp web application. Admins (registered) users can login and access an "add-content" page or modify/delete content in the regular pages, clicking on the "edit" (pencil icon) button, modifying the text in the editor and submitting.

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via a platform of your choice. To use this command, you need to first add a package that implements end-to-end testing capabilities.
